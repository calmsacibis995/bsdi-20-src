WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY FTP SERVER, RELEASE 2.2 - Apr 1, 1994

wu-ftpd is a replacement ftp server for Un*x systems.  Besides
supporting the ftp protocol defined in RFC 959, it adds the following
features:
    o  logging of transfers
    o  logging of commands
    o  on the fly compression and archiving
    o  classification of users on type and location
    o  per class limits
    o  per directory upload permissions
    o  restricted guest accounts
    o  system wide and per directory messages.
    o  directory alias
    o  cdpath
    o  filename filter

This will be the final full release of the 2.x release of wu-ftpd.
Beside bug-fixes, no more work will be done on the 2.x versions.  We
plan to rewrite large parts of the server and integrate the extended
functionality into the next big release.

For help setting up this server, you can try the following sources:

    o  _Managing Internet Information Services_, An O'Reilly and Associates
       book.  Expected release: April/May.  This book has an excellent
       chapter on setting up anonymous ftp sites using standard ftp servers
       as well as the wu-ftp server.
