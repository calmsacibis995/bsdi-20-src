1. Rewrite realpath() so it's not such a piece of junk

2. Write a password editor for the groupaccess file

3. Add logging on commands, connect, disconnect, refusals, etc. to logfile.
   Make logfile ftplog rather than xferlog.

4. Add multi-class code.

5. Enhance ftp-pid files to become single file with continuous process
   status.

6. Write xferstats in C for speed and more options.

7. Write ftpstat program, including -k option to kill off all FTP daemons

8. Add checksuming capabilities for transmitted files.
   SITE CHECKMETHOD <method> 
   SITE CHECKSUM [<file>]

   If <file> not specified, return checksum for last transmitted file.

9. Write dynamic ftp monitoring program

10. Add ability to log different info to different files

11. Write ftplogd.  Ftp processes send log info to ftplogd which configurably
    writes data to a lot of different places (syslog[@loghost], logfile(s)).

12. Add ability to limit total connections from any domain.

13. Limit the number of files/bytes a user can transfer at one sitting.

14. Limit the total time a session can take.

15. Add byte, file and time quotas.

16. Add "guestuser" command to complement "guestgroup".

17. Keep track of total file transfer and command response byte counts

18. Include descriptive ls program, add ".private" file to disable
    directory listings...

19. Include system load as a limit parameter (load < xxx, maxusers = nnn)

20. Allow access control commands to specify remote 
    addresses by network+netmask.

21. Allow access control by remote username (if authenticated)

22. Log more information into PID files:
        - files/bytes transferred
        - current action (a la SETPROCNAME)
        - remote host
        - classes

23. write an ftp status program to take advantage of new PID file
