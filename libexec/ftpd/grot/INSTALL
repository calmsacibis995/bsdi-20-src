INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1.  edit src/pathnames.h to conform to your needs.  

    _PATH_FTPUSERS  "/etc/ftpusers"
        The file that lists users that can never ftp in.  Usually contains
        root and all usernames not connected to a real person (eg. bin, sync,
        nobody, etc.)
    _PATH_FTPACCESS "/usr/local/etc/ftpaccess"
        The configuration file for the server.
    _PATH_FTPHOSTS  "/etc/ftphosts"
        The individual user access configuration file.
**  _PATH_EXECPATH  "/bin/ftp-exec"
        The directory that contains additional binaries for use with the
        SITE EXEC command.
    _PATH_PIDNAMES  "/usr/local/daemon/ftpd/ftp.pids-%s"
        The filename template for pid files.  The %s gets automagically 
        replaced by the proper classname.  There will be as many pid files
        as there are classes in your ftpaccess.
    _PATH_CVT       "/usr/local/etc/ftpconversions"
        The file that contains the conversion (file -> file.Z, etc) 
        configuration.  See ftpconversions.5 for a description of the format.
    _PATH_XFERLOG   "/usr/adm/xferlog"
        The file where all logging information is placed.
    _PATH_PRIVATE   "/etc/ftpgroups"
        The group password file for use with the SITE GROUP and SITE GPASS
        commands.  See ftpaccess.5 for a description of the format.
    _PATH_UTMP      "/etc/utmp"
        Where your utmp file lives.
    _PATH_WTMP      "/usr/adm/wtmp"
        Where your wtmp file lives.
    _PATH_LASTLOG   "/usr/adm/lastlog"
        Where your lastlog file lives.
    _PATH_BSHELL    "/bin/sh"
        Where bourne shell lives
    _PATH_DEVNULL   "/dev/null"
        What /dev/null is.  I can't imagine that this could ever be different.

**  This path is relative to ~ftp.  To add the same functionality for real
    users, create a symbolic link from ~ftp/_PATH_EXEC to /_PATH_EXEC.

2a. build xxx

    where xxx is one of:
        gen : generic make (copy this when porting to a new system)
        aix : IBM AIX
        bsd : BSDI bsd/386
        dgx : Data General Unix
        dyn : Dynix
        hpx : HP-UX
		isc : ISC
        lnx : Linux (tested on 0.99p8)
        nx2 : NeXTstep 2.x
        nx3 : NeXTstep 3.x
        osf : OSF/1
        ptx : ???
        sgi : SGI Irix 4.0.5a
        sny : Sony NewsOS
        sol : SunOS 5.x / Solaris 2.x
        s41 : SunOS 4.1.x (requires acc or gcc 2.3.3 or better)
                          (if you must use gcc 1.4.2, mail me for a patch)
        ult : Ultrix 4.x

    If cc complains about strunames, typenames, modenames, ... being undefined
    you need to install support/ftp.h as /usr/include/arpa/ftp.h (always make
    a backup of the old ftp.h just in case!) and do the build again.  The new
    ftp.h should be a compatible superset of your existing ftp.h, so you
    shouldn't have problems with this replacement.

    If you are using gcc...  Make sure that you the include files have been
    properly "fixed" according to the gcc 2.3.3 INSTALL instructions.  If
    the server crashes before printing the banner message (during a vprintf)
    this is most probably the cause.

    Some machines may not have a definition of pid_t; so if your compiler
    complains about this you should add to src/config.h

            typedef int pid_t;

2b. If your system is not defined above...
        cp src/config/config.gen src/config/config.xxx
        cp src/makefiles/Makefile.gen src/makefiles/Makefile.xxx
        cp support/makefiles/Makefile.gen support/makefiles/Makefile.xxx

    Edit the three files appropriately.  Go back to step 2a.

3.  build install

4.  edit /etc/inetd.conf to point to the new ftpd

5.  on BSD-ish systems: kill -1 `ps t"?" | grep inetd`
    on SGI systems: /etc/killall -HUP inetd

6.  for the server to support creation of .tar.Z files of directories, you
    need GNU tar installed [remember to put a copy in the anonymous ftp
    hierarchy].  If you need a copy, it is available from
    wuarchive.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4] in /gnu.

7.  copy /wherever/compress to ~ftp/bin/compress.

8.  copy the ftpconversions, ftpusers, and ftpgroups files to the 
    locations specifed in pathnames.h.  There are examples of these
    files in the doc/examples directory.

9.  create the directory for the SITE EXEC programs, as specified in 
    pathnames.h.  Put any executables that you want anonymous users to 
    be able to run in this directory.  Be careful what you put here.

10. run bin/ckconfig to make sure that all the support files are
    properly installed.


SOME NOTES ABOUT THE FTP SERVER:

1.  You need to have at least *one* class defined in the ftpaccess file.
    In the next release, this will change.

2.  The ftpd(8) man page that came with your Operating System should do a
    good job of explaining how to set up the anonymous ftp hierarchy.
    At the very least, you will need ~ftp/bin (mode: 111 ---x--x--x)
    with a copy of "ls" (mode: 111 ---x--x--x) and ~ftp/etc 
    (mode: 111 ---x--x--x) with an /etc/passwd.

3.  Don't put encrypted passwords in ~ftp/etc/passwd.  In fact, all you
    really need is entries for root and ftp.  "ls" is the only part
    of the server that uses this file.

4.  Anonymous FTP may have some troubles on machines which use dynamic
    shared libraries.  The most common of these is SunOS 4.1.x.  You
    will have trouble with using the binaries in ~ftp/bin if those
    binaries were compiled using those shared libraries, as the
    chroot() that ftpd does for anonymous users to ~ftp means that
    those links to the static libraries are lost.  You cannot make a
    hard link or soft link to the libraries as the chroot will make
    those links meaningless. There are two ways to fix this:

    1) Track down, using ldd, all the shared libs used by each binary you
       want to put in ~ftp/bin.  Then copy these into their
       corresponding places in ~ftp: i.e., /usr/lib/ld.so must be
       copied into ~ftp/usr/lib/ld.so.  However, ldd does not always
       show all the files that a compiled program may try to reference;
       if you use trace you can see every system call a binary makes,
       and that should show you every dependency.  If you compiled with
       gcc, there are likely to be lots of references made.

    2) Recompile any binary you wish to put in ~ftp/bin (ls, gzip, gtar,
       etc) using the -Bstatic (or -static in gcc) option in the CFLAGS
       *and* LDFLAGS options in their respective makefiles.  You can
       get GNU versions of ls and gzip and everything else from
       wuarchive.wustl.edu.  This is the easiest and most foolproof
       method - the statically compiled binaries may be a tad bigger,
       but you can use strip to pare down the size.
    [thanks to Brian Behlendorf for rewriting #4 more elegantly.]

5.  Make sure that you have a /etc/shells that lists all valid shells on
    your system.  Otherwise, those who have shells not listed there will
    not be able to log in.  [Yes, this is the expected behaivor.]

    Under Solaris 2.1, there is no /etc/shells by default.

6.  Under Solaris 2.1, you need to have the following in ~ftp/dev
      crw-rw-rw-  1 root      11,  42 Mar 24 17:00 tcp
      cr--r--r--  1 root      13,  12 Mar 24 16:23 zero

7.  Under OSF/1, you need ~ftp/etc/sia/siainitgood.

8.  Under DEC Ultrix, you need ~ftp/etc/svc.conf

9.  NeXT systems:  You need a copy of /usr/shlib/libsys_s.B.shlib in 
    ~ftp/usr/shlib/libsys_s.B.shlib.  Make sure that ~ftp/usr, ~ftp/usr/shlib
    are mode 0555 (dr-xr-xr-x) and ~ftp/usr/shlib/libsys_s.B.shlib is mode 
    0555 (-r-xr-xr-x).

10. If you are using this system under Linux, you will get lots of warnings
    about problems when you compile - Just ignore them...
    You will probably need at least libc4.3.3 and gcc2.3.3 to compile this..
    You will also get (for now at least) errors (sometimes) when you do an
    ls or dir command.. This is a bug in the current Linux libraries..
    It will say :-
    425 Can not build Data Connection. Transport Endpoint Already Connected.
    (Or something like that...) Just retype the ls/dir command until it works
    all other commands work fine..
                                [karl@hci.national-physical-lab.co.uk]

11. Certains files need to be inside the anonymous ftp hierarchy.
    They are all referenced after the chroot(~ftp):
        all messages (deny, welcome, etc.)
        shutdown 
        _PATH_EXECPATH

12. In order for shutdown to work properly for real, guest, and anonymous
    users -- you must create a link.  
    
    For example... if shutdown is defined to be /etc/shutmsg:
        root# ln -s ~ftp/etc/shutmsg /etc/shutmsg

    That way, when ftpshut creates the shutdown message, it will be
    within the real user space and the anonymous user space.

13. I would like to publically thank all the beta-testers that I have
    had for this release.  They are (in alphabetical order):

14. There are two mailing lists available that discuss the server.
    They are wu-ftpd and wu-ftpd-announce.  To subscribe to either 
    send a "subscribe <listname>" message to listserv@wunet.wustl.edu

15. If you use the server (and like it!) -- send me a note.  Since
    this project is funded from a grant, it would be nice to show the
    superiors how widely used it is.  If you have really bizarre
    problems that you can not figure out, feel free to mail me and I
    will try to help.  I warn you that response time may be a bit slow...
    But I will do my best to help.
