This is the 6.3 version of the TCP/IP daemon wrapper package. Release
6.2 was cancelled because of a significant source code contribution
from Sequent.

With these programs you can monitor and control who connects to your
TFTP, EXEC, FTP, RSH, TELNET, RLOGIN, FINGER, and SYSTAT network
services, and many others.

The programs can be installed without any changes to existing software
or configuration files. By default, they just log the remote host name
and do some sanity checks on the origin of the request. No information
is exchanged with the remote client process.

Changes since release 6.1;

    - Portability: new Makefile rule sets for SCO and Pyramid OSx 5.1;
      improved TLI support for Dynix/PTX; fix for Ultrix core dumps.

    - Features: compile-time option (APPEND_DOT) for faster DNS lookup
      of already fully-qualified hostnames; a run-time option to enable
      keepalives (useful when users reset or turn off the PC while
      still connected), and an option to change the process nice value.

Good news: Sun patch 100804-03 for SunOS 4.1.x fixes the problem with
the anti source-routing attack feature.

The libwrap.a code should be binary compatible with release 6.1.
