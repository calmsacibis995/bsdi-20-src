.Sh NAME
.Nm msync
.Nd synchronize a mapped region
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mman.h>
.Ft int
.Fn msync "caddr_t addr" "int len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn msync
system call
writes any modified pages back to the filesystem and updates
the file modification time.
If
.Fa len
is 0, all modified pages within the region containing
.Fa addr
will be flushed;
if
.Fa len
is non-zero, only the pages containing
.Fa addr
and
.Fa len
succeeding locations will be examined.
Any required synchronization of memory caches
will also take place at this time.
Filesystem operations on a file that is mapped for shared modifications
are unpredictable except after an
.Fn msync .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn msync
will return 0; otherwise a value
of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Msync
will fail and memory protection will remain unchanged if:
.Bl -tag -width [EINVAL]
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa Addr
is not mapped or is not page-aligned.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa Len
is negative or out of range.
.It Bq Er EIO
An error was encountered while writing
data to the filesystem.
