# bsd_help
The BSD Partitioning screen is used to define filesystems to be mounted
by BSD/OS.  To install BSD/OS you must have at least a root filesystem (/),
a swap partition, and a /usr filesystem.  Typically the root filesystem
is at least 8MB, swap is at least the size of memory, and /usr is the
remainder of the space allocated to BSD/OS.  If you plan to have /tmp
mounted in memory, you should make the swap partition at least 16 MB,
preferably more.  For more information on determining sizes, please
refer to the installation guide for help in determining how much disk
space you will need to install BSD/OS.

At this point you may either go on to the next phase, alter a filesystem
displayed in the filesystem table, define a filesystem, delete the
description of a filesystem, or exit this phase with out making any
changes.

You may use one of the following commands:

A   Use 'A' to add a new partition.  Disksetup will default the new
    partition to the next needed partition.

D   Use 'D' to delete the definition of a partition.  You will need to
    do this if your disk has old data on it that you no longer want.
    Deleting a partition will cause you to lose all the data contained
    in that partition.

E   Use 'E' to change any of the parameters of a partition.  Generally
    you will only need to delete and add partitions.

I   Use 'I' to import an FDISK partition as a BSD/OS partition.  Use
    this to assign a DOS partition to a BSD/OS partition (typically
    the 'd' partition) to allow BSD/OS to mount the DOS partition.
    Currently Extended DOS partitions will need hand management once
    imported.  If there is only one extended DOS partition, it will
    actually start 1 track farther in than the imported partition's
    starting offset.

N   Use 'N' to record the changes you have made and go on to the next
    phase of disksetup.  The changes will actually be applied when
    you finish setting up your disk.  At that time you will have one
    more chance to request that these changes (and all other changes
    during this session of disksetup) to not be made.

X   Discard all changes to the partition table and exit this phase of
    the program.  No changes to the partition table will be written to
    the disk.
#
# fdisk_qhelp
At this point you should define, alter, or delete the partitions for

operating systems. Press N when you are done or X if you wish to cancel.

# fdisk_help
The FDISK screen is used to divide (partition) your hard disk for
use by one or more operating systems.  To install BSD/OS, you must have a
partition assigned to BSD/OS which has enough space to install its
filesystems on this disk.  Please refer to the installation guide for
help in determining how much disk space you will need to install BSD/OS.

At this point you may either go on to the next phase, alter a partition
displayed in the partition table, add a partition to the partition
table, delete a partition from the partition table, or exit this phase
with out making any changes.

You may use one of the following commands:

A   Use 'A' to add a new partition.  For instance, you will need to have
    at least one partition for BSD/OS.  If you want to run DOS (or some
    other O/S) you will need a partition for it as well.

D   Use 'D' to delete the definition of a partition.  You will need to
    do this if your disk has old data on it that you no longer want.
    Deleting a partition will cause you to lose all the data contained
    in that partition.

*   Use '*' to assign the active boot partition.  The standard master
    boot record (MBR) will boot from which ever partition is marked
    active.  If you use the BOOTANY bootstrap, the active partition
    determines the default partition to boot from.

E   Use 'E' to change any of the parameters of a partition.  Generally
    you will only need to delete and add partitions.

N   Use 'N' to record the changes you have made and go on to the next
    phase of disksetup.  The changes will actually be applied when
    you finish setting up your disk.  At that time you will have one
    more chance to request that these changes (and all other changes

    the disk.

# main_multipleos_long
BSD/OS may be installed as

    * The only operating system on the disk
    * Sharing the disk with other operating systems, such as DOS.

#
# main_multipleos_long_fdisk
Disksetup has detected an FDISK label on your disk.  This may be an indication
of another operating system already installed on the disk.  BSD/OS may
installed either as the only operating system on the disk, or it may share the
disk with other operating systems, such as DOS.
#
# main_multipleos
Do you wish to share this disk with other operating systems?
#
# main_newfdisk_long
Disksetup has detected an FDISK table on your disk.  You may either start
with this FDISK table or create a new FDISK table.  If you create a new
FDISK table you will lose all information on this disk.
#
# main_newfdisk
Use the current FDISK label?
#
# main_typical_long
A typical multi-OS installation includes only BSD/OS and DOS with an
optional shared swap partition.
#
# main_typical
Is this your configuration?
#
# main_space_long
Disksetup will intitialize your disk with 2 FDISK partitions.  You
must choose how much space to assign BSD/OS and how much for DOS.
BSD/OS requires between 60 and 300 MB of disk space depending on the
installation options chosen.  Typically you should try to have at least
120 MB for BSD/OS, 200 if you plan to use the X Window System.
#
# main_space
How much space would you like to assign to DOS?
#
# main_coswap_long
Disksetup recommends %dMB be reserved for swap.
Some users have found that they would like to share a partition for
BSD/OS's swap partition with an extended DOS partition used for a
windows temporary swap file.  This typically would be done on a
system with disk space concerns, such as a laptop.
#
# main_coswap
How much space would you like to assign to swap (0 -> no shared swap)?
#
# main_swap_to_small
You have not assigned enough space to the shared swap partition.
#
# main_get_dos_geom_long
The geometry (number of heads, sectors per track and number of
cylinders) of the disk that will be used by the generic boot
block (and DOS as well as other systems which use the BIOS)
must be known in order to create an FDISK partition.  Disksetup
will try to automatically determine this geometry...

#
# main_get_dos_geom
Would you like to view or change the BIOS geometry for the disk?
#
# main_get_bsd_geom_long
The geometry (number of heads, sectors per track and number of
cylinders) of the disk that will be used by BSD/OS must be known in
order to properly create a disk label.

#
# main_possible_geometries
The geometry (number of heads, sectors per track and number of
cylinders) for the disk is needed.  Disksetup will do its best
to assist you in picking the geometry.  It is possible to find
the geometry from several places.  Below is a table of geometries
easily determined by disksetup.  (The BSD/OS geometry is only defined
if this disk has been previously labeled.)

#
# will_use_fdisk_geometry
Disksetup recommends the geometry determined from the FDISK table for DOS.
#
# will_use_bios_geometry
Disksetup recommends the geometry determined from the BIOS for
the FDISK table.
#
# will_use_cmos_geometry
Disksetup recommends the geometry determined from the CMOS for
the FDISK table.
#
# will_use_bsd_geometry
Disksetup will use the BSD/OS geometry for the FDISK table, but you
should verify this is correct for your BIOS and change the geometry
if not.

Press <ENTER> to continue:
#
# main_default_bsd_geom
Disksetup will default the DOS geometry to the geometry to be used by
BSD/OS.  It is possible this the wrong geometry, so please check
the geometry by using it.
Press <ENTER> to continue.
#
# main_get_bsd_geom
Would you like to view or change the BSD geometry for this disk?
#
# alter_geometry

#
# geometry_file
The file name entered must reference a file which contains a valid
disk label of the kind produced by disksetup.
Please enter the file name:
#
# disktab_entry
The type entered must be one of the types of a disk found in
the /etc/disktab file.

#
# bad_label_file
The file %s is not a valid label file.
#
# pick_geometry
There are several methods of initializing the geometry.  Note that
probing some SCSI disks or busy SCSI disks, may have undesired results
(such has hanging) hence you should only probe a disk from single user.

Your options are:
#
# invalid_geometry
The geometry retrieved was invalid.
#
# main_need_bsd_geom_long
The geometry of the drive must now be determined.  lf this disk was
previously labeled, you should try using the [I]nternal geometry.
A new disk typically should be [P]robed.  Problem disks should be
entered by hand.
#
# main_need_bsd_geom_coex_long
The geometry of the drive that will be used by BSD/OS must now be determined.
lf this disk was previously labeled, you should try using the [I]nternal
geometry.  A new disk typically should be [P]robed.  You may wish to enter
the BIOS geometry (if defined)  if you want the geometry to match that of
your other operating system.
#
# main_need_dos_geom_long

#
# main_cant_keep_existing_bsd_long
Your disk appears to have a valid BSD partition table.
It appears that you have altered (or added) the FDISK table and
hence this partition table is probably no longer valid and you
should start with a clean table.  Note that starting with a clean
table will cause all data on the disk to be lost.

#
# main_keep_existing_bsd_long
Your disk appears to have a valid BSD partition table.
You may either start with this table or start with a clean table.
Note that starting with a clean table, or altering any partitions

#
# main_new_master_long
The master boot record is located at the beginning of the disk with
the FDISK table.  The master boot record determines which FDISK
partition to boot from.  You may choose to either use the existing
master boot record or install a new master boot record.  The master
boot record provided with BSD/OS allows up to 4 operating systems to
be booted.  (Some operating systems have been noted to not work with
this master boot record.)

set up which partitions are bootable.

Press <ENTER> to continue.
#
# bootany_run

The bootany(8) utility will now be run.  This utility will allow you

#
# main_moved_bootblocks_long
The location for the BSD/OS boot blocks has moved and hence the
old boot blocks will not work.
#
# no_place_to_label
Disksetup can find no place to label this disk.  This implies that
there is an FDISK table, but not partitions marked for use by BSD/OS,
but a BSD/OS label is still required.  Disksetup can still label the
disk, but this will destroy any information on sector 1 of the disk.
Disksetup will not write any BSD/OS boot blocks to this disk.
